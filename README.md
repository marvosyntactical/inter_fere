This will one day be the github for my verb semantics project """Pragmatic Modelling of Ellipses Using First Order Logic Semantic Representations"""


The below is taken from the [official pyro github examples](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/tree/dev/examples/rsa)

## Rational Speech Acts (RSA) examples

This folder contains examples of reasoning about reasoning with nested inference
adapted from work by @ngoodman and collaborators.
